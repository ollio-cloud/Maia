# Repository Governance System

**STATUS**: ⚠️ ASPIRATIONAL - Tools referenced in this document are not yet implemented

## Purpose
Unified command interface for repository sprawl prevention and governance using ML-enhanced policy engine and integrated monitoring system.

**Current Alternative**: Use `ufc_compliance_checker.py` for basic compliance validation

## System Architecture
The governance system consists of 5 integrated components:
1. **Repository Analyzer** - Structure analysis and health scoring
2. **Filesystem Monitor** - Real-time violation detection  
3. **Remediation Engine** - Automated fix system with intelligent backup
4. **Enhanced Policy Engine** - ML-enhanced pattern recognition and adaptive policies
5. **Governance Dashboard** - Web interface with ML insights

## Commands

### System Management
- `governance status` - Show system health and compliance across all 5 components
- `governance scan` - Full repository compliance scan with ML-enhanced analysis
- `governance monitor` - Start real-time monitoring with pattern detection
- `governance dashboard` - Launch web dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8070

### Policy Management
- `governance policies list` - Show current YAML policy configuration
- `governance policies check <file>` - ML-enhanced file compliance check with confidence scores
- `governance policies update` - Update policy configuration with adaptive ML recommendations
- `governance policies train` - Train ML models on violation history

### Remediation
- `governance fix --auto` - Apply automated fixes with ML confidence-based triggering
- `governance fix --interactive` - Interactive fix mode with ML recommendations
- `governance rollback <action_id>` - Rollback changes using intelligent backup system

### Reporting & Analytics
- `governance report daily` - Generate daily compliance report with ML insights
- `governance report violations` - Show recent violations with pattern analysis
- `governance metrics` - Show governance metrics and ML model performance
- `governance recommendations` - Generate adaptive policy recommendations

## Implementation

### Command Structure
All commands are implemented through the governance component CLIs:

## Integration with UFC System
- **Hook Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing `user-prompt-submit` enforcement
- **UFC Compatibility**: Maintains 100% compatibility with context loading system
- **Structure Enhancement**: Extends UFC structure with governance monitoring without disruption
- **Policy Enforcement**: YAML policies stored in `claude/context/knowledge/governance/policies.yaml`

## Production Deployment
- **Background Monitoring**: Filesystem monitoring runs continuously detecting violations
- **Web Dashboard**: Available at http://127.0.0.1:8070 with real-time metrics and ML insights
- **Alert Integration**: Violations integrate with existing notification system
- **ML Enhancement**: Local ML models provide 99.3% cost savings vs cloud-based analysis
- **Service Health**: All 5 components monitored with comprehensive health checking

## Usage Examples

### Daily Governance Workflow
```bash
# Morning check
governance status

# Full weekly scan
governance scan

# Check specific changes
governance policies check path/to/modified/file.py

# Generate weekly report
governance report daily > weekly_governance_report.md
```

### Policy Management Workflow
```bash
# Review current policies
governance policies list

# Train ML models on new violation data
governance policies train

# Get adaptive recommendations
governance recommendations

# Update policies with ML insights
governance policies update
```

### Remediation Workflow
```bash
# Auto-fix with ML confidence scoring
governance fix --auto

# Interactive review for complex violations
governance fix --interactive

# Monitor results
governance metrics
```

## System Integration Points

### With Existing Maia Infrastructure
- **Dashboard Hub**: Integrates with existing dashboard service registry
- **Agent System**: Governance Policy Engine Agent coordinates all components
- **Local LLMs**: Uses optimal_local_llm_interface.py for cost-efficient ML operations
- **Hook System**: Extends user-prompt-submit hook with governance checks

### With External Systems
- **Git Integration**: Pre-commit violation detection and prevention
- **Monitoring Integration**: Real-time alerts and notification system
- **Backup Integration**: Intelligent backup system for safe remediation
- **API Access**: RESTful APIs for external system integration

This unified governance system transforms repository management from reactive cleanup to **proactive, intelligent governance** with ML-enhanced pattern recognition and automated remediation capabilities.
