# ServiceDesk Automation Project - Context & Knowledge Base

**Purpose**: Persistent storage of business context, decisions, and answers to prevent knowledge loss across sessions

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-16 (16:45 - CSV corruption issue identified)
**Project Status**: Discovery phase complete, preparing XLSX re-import to fix CSV corruption

## 🚨 CRITICAL CONTEXT SHIFT (Oct 16, 2025)

**IMPORTANT**: Initial ServiceDesk Manager Agent analysis focused on cost reduction and ROI ($242K-$850K savings). However, user clarification reveals:

### Actual Project Goals (NOT Cost Reduction!)
1. **Primary**: Improve client satisfaction through quality improvements
2. **Secondary**: Find automation opportunities that improve quality
3. **Focus**: Monitor and reduce sub-optimal behaviors (ticket flicking, excessive internal updates)
4. **Metrics**: Quality, FCR, customer communication %, not cost savings

### Implications
- ROI analysis in this document remains valid but is **secondary consideration**
- Automation priorities should focus on **quality improvement** not time savings
- Success = better tickets, higher FCR, more customer-facing communication
- Budget is not constrained - any quality-improving initiative with ROI will be considered

### Next Agent Engagement
ServiceDesk Manager Agent needs to **re-analyze automation opportunities** with quality/satisfaction lens, not cost reduction lens.

### Data Quality Notes
- **Issue Identified**: Sample tickets show placeholder values "[TKT-Key] TKT-Summary" instead of actual data
- **Root Cause**: Field name issue - "TKT-Key" and "TKT-Summary" are literal values in those columns (data quality issue in source)
- **Impact**: Cannot validate exact ticket details, but patterns and volumes are accurate
- **Status**: Fixed ID mapping between ChromaDB and SQLite (using "TKT-Ticket ID" field)

### Time Period Covered
- **Documents Analyzed**: 213,947
- **Time Period**: July 1, 2025 to October 15, 2025 (~3.5 months)
- **Data Source**: 3 CSV reports exported from internal system
- **Future Process**: Planning daily incremental report imports
- **Current Resolution Times**: Unknown - needs analysis (priority metric to establish)

## 📝 Session History

### 2025-10-16 - Discovery & Analysis Session
- Completed Phase 118.3: RAG quality upgrade (E5-base-v2)
- Fixed ID mapping issues between ChromaDB and SQLite
- Generated automation opportunity discovery report (415 opportunities)
- Engaged ServiceDesk Manager Agent for ROI analysis
- Identified need for structured project context (this file)

### 2025-10-16 (16:45) - CSV Corruption Issue Identified
**Problem Discovered**: CSV import (Oct 14, 2025) caused data corruption
- **Root Cause**: Unescaped commas in comment text → CSV parser sees 3,564 fields instead of 10
- **Impact**:
  - Column misalignment after comment_text field (position #3)
  - **CT-VISIBLE-CUSTOMER field corrupted** (position #8) - CRITICAL for customer communication % metric!
  - Comment text may be truncated at comma boundaries
  - RAG embeddings created from corrupted text
- **Decision**: Re-import from source XLSX files + Re-RAG from clean data
- **Files Ready**:
  - comments.xlsx (88MB, Oct 14 06:19)
  - tickets.xlsx (322MB, Oct 14 15:38)
  - timesheets.xlsx (104MB, Oct 14 07:53)
- **Import Tool**: Already supports XLSX (pandas + openpyxl installed)
- **Approach**:
  1. Full clean import (drop tables, re-import from XLSX)
  2. Validate CT-VISIBLE-CUSTOMER field populated correctly
  3. Re-RAG all collections from clean SQLite data (3-4 hours)
- **Status**: Ready to execute

### Next Session Actions
1. ✅ **Fill knowledge gaps**: User answered all 14 critical questions (documented in this file)
2. **Execute XLSX re-import + Re-RAG**: See detailed plan in `SERVICEDESK_XLSX_REIMPORT_PLAN.md`
   - 10-step recovery plan documented
   - Estimated time: 4-5 hours total
   - Critical validation: CT-VISIBLE-CUSTOMER field population
3. **Re-establish baselines**: Verify FCR, ticket counts, date ranges post-import
4. **Validate priorities**: User approval on Top 5 automation patterns
5. **Begin Phase 1 design**: Password reset + email diagnostics workflows
