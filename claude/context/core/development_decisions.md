# Development Decisions - Maia System

## Overview
This document captures significant development decisions, workflow agreements, and process improvements made during conversations with Naythan. These decisions shape how Maia operates and evolves.

## Decision Preservation Protocol
*Established: 2025-01-22*

### Problem Identified
Decisions made during conversations are often not saved, leading to:
- Lost agreements and workflows
- Repeated discussions of same topics
- Context resets losing important decisions
- Requirements drift during implementation

### Solution Approach
**Explicit Save Triggers + Decision Buffer Pattern**

#### Recognition Triggers (when to save)
- User says "yes", "that sounds good", "let's do that", "I agree"
- New process or workflow established
- Technical decision or architecture choice made
- Agreement reached on any approach

#### Immediate Response Pattern
```
User: "Yes, that sounds good"
Maia: "Let me save this decision before we continue..." [SAVE]
Maia: "Saved to [file]. Now, [continue with next topic]"
```

#### Save Locations
- Development workflows → `/claude/context/core/development_decisions.md` (this file)
- TDD/testing decisions → `/claude/context/core/tdd_development_protocol.md`
- Project-specific → `/[project]/decisions.md`
- System improvements → Update relevant context files
- Tool/agent updates → Update available.md or agents.md

### Why Decisions Get Lost
- Caught up in problem-solving momentum
- Conversation flow carries past save points
- Focus on solving rather than documenting
- No automatic trigger for persistence
- Like having a great meeting but forgetting to write minutes

### Success Metrics
- Zero "we discussed this before" moments
- All decisions retrievable in future contexts
- Natural conversation flow maintained
- Decisions available after context resets

## TDD Development Protocol
*Established: 2025-01-22*
*Full details: `/claude/context/core/tdd_development_protocol.md`*

### Key Decisions
1. **Requirements before tests**: Complete requirements discovery phase before writing any tests
2. **Explicit checkpoint**: Wait for "requirements complete" confirmation before proceeding
3. **Persistent documentation**: Create requirements.md for every TDD project
4. **Test-first discipline**: Tests encode requirements, no implementation without tests
5. **Regular verification**: Check requirements alignment throughout development

### Workflow Triggers
- "Let's do TDD" → Full discovery protocol
- "Requirements complete" → Proceed to test phase
- "Check requirements" → Re-read requirements file
- "Show me the tests" → Validate coverage

## Maia ITR (Intelligent Tool Registry) Project
*Established: 2025-01-22*
*Status: ARCHITECT-VALIDATED PLAN - Ready for Implementation*
*Evolution: Simplified from complex HVDA based on architect review*

### Maia ITR Project Vision
**Goal**: Solve 406-tool discovery failures with intelligent versioning and registry
**Core Insight**: Simple versioning provides 80% of benefits with 20% of complexity
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for core benefits, optional enhancements later
**Expected Outcome**: 95%+ discovery accuracy, 406 → ~100 active tools

### Problem Analysis (Enhanced)
- **Current State**: 406 tools causing 40-60% discovery failures
- **Growth Reality**: Will grow back to 400+ tools even after cleanup
- **Scaling Challenge**: Linear loading (more tools = more context) unsustainable
- **Architecture Need**: System that handles 1000+ tools with same efficiency as 100

└── compression_map.json                 # Compression metadata
```

#### **Three-Tier Intelligence System**

1. **Registry (Routing Intelligence)**
   - Primary tool selection per domain
   - Specialist tool conditional loading
   - Version management and relationships

2. **Compression (Storage Intelligence)**
   - Semantic compression per tool
   - Critical section preservation
   - 70-80% size reduction

3. **Smart Loading (Context Intelligence)**
   - Load 1 primary per domain (not 27 tools)
   - Lazy expansion for specialists
   - Logarithmic scaling (1000 tools = 12 loaded)

### Implementation Strategy

#### **Phase 1: Version + Basic Hierarchy** (Week 1 - 20 hours)
- Analyze 406 files for version relationships
- Implement versioning scheme (tool_v1, tool_v2)
- Create archived/ directory structure
- Update discovery for version-based selection
- **Deliverable**: 406 → 50-100 active versioned tools

#### **Phase 2: Domain Organization** (Week 2 - 15 hours)
- Create domain directories (research/, security/, etc.)
- Move versioned tools to domain structure
- Update import paths and references
- **Deliverable**: Hierarchical organization, 27 tools/domain average

#### **Phase 3: Registry + Compression** (Week 3-4 - 25 hours)
- Build intelligent registry system
- Implement compression mapping
- Create lazy loading system
- Integrate with existing discovery
- **Deliverable**: 95% discovery accuracy, 70% compression

#### **Phase 4: Production Optimization** (Month 2 - 20 hours)
- Add specialist variant support
- Optimize per-domain compression
- Performance tuning and validation
- **Deliverable**: Production-ready for 1000+ tools

### Scaling Projections

| Tool Count | Domains | Tools/Domain | Context Loaded | Compression | Final Context |
|------------|---------|--------------|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| 100 (cleaned) | 15 | ~7 | 5-10 tools | Optional | ~8 tools |
| 400 (future) | 15 | ~27 | 5-10 tools | Essential | ~3 tools |
| 1000 (scale) | 20 | ~50 | 8-12 tools | Critical | ~3 tools |

   - Selective loading
   - Quality preservation
   - Semantic awareness

### Success Metrics
- **Discovery Accuracy**: 95%+ (from current 60%)
- **Context Reduction**: 99% (400 tools → 3-4 tool-equivalents)
- **Scaling Efficiency**: O(log n) context growth vs O(n) tool growth
- **Maintenance**: Monthly archival reduces active set by 20%

### Risk Mitigation
- **Phased Implementation**: Each phase independently valuable
- **Backward Compatibility**: Old tools continue working
- **Graceful Degradation**: Each tier can fail independently
- **Rollback Points**: Each phase reversible

### Integration with Context Compression
- **Synergy**: Versioning reduces targets from 406 → 50
- **Simplified Compression**: Clear boundaries (active vs archived)
- **Compound Benefits**: Version (87%) × Compression (70%) = 96% reduction
- **Future-Proof**: Architecture handles growth without linear context increase

### Architect Review Results & Plan Revision
*Reviewed: 2025-01-22*

#### **Architect Feedback Analysis**
- **Critical Issue Identified**: Maia 2.0 plugin system is DIFFERENT problem (enterprise deployment) vs current 406-tool organization
- **Valid HVDA Concerns**: Registry single point of failure, migration risk, potential over-engineering
- **Recommended Approach**: Start simple with versioning, add complexity only if needed

#### **REVISED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN** ⭐ **FINAL APPROACH**

**Phase 1: Simple Versioning (Week 1 - 15 hours)**
- Analyze 406 tools for actual version relationships
- Rename to clear version hierarchy (research_v3.py, security_v2.py)
- Archive old versions to /archived/ directory
- Update discovery to prefer highest version numbers
- **Deliverable**: 406 → ~100 active tools, 95% discovery accuracy

**Phase 2: Basic Registry (Week 2 - 10 hours)**
- Simple routing based on version numbers and domains
- Optional metadata for tool relationships
- Graceful fallback to file-based discovery
- **Deliverable**: Intelligent tool selection without complexity

**Phase 3: Optional Enhancements (Future)**
- Add compression only if context still too large
- Add domain organization if beneficial
- Expand registry intelligence as needed

#### **Why This Approach Wins**
1. **Addresses Real Problem**: 406 tools in claude/tools/ (not future Maia 2.0)
2. **Low Risk**: Gradual implementation, each phase independently valuable
3. **Immediate Benefit**: Versioning alone solves 80% of discovery issues
4. **Future-Proof**: Can add complexity later if needed

#### **Success Metrics**
- **Phase 1**: >90% discovery accuracy through clear version hierarchy
- **Phase 2**: <5 second tool selection with intelligent routing
- **Overall**: 95% accuracy, manageable maintenance, scalable to 1000+ tools

### Ready State
**Revised plan based on architect review. Focus on simple versioning first, complexity only as needed.**

## KAI File Sprawl Control Research
*Established: 2025-01-22*
*Context: User asked about KAI project file sprawl control strategies*

### Key Findings from KAI Research
1. **Hierarchical Domain Organization**: Emoji-based visual domains (🏗️ Core, 💼 Professional, 💰 Financial, etc.)
2. **Archive Consolidation Strategy**: Date-based archiving with proper manifests and broken file separation
3. **Tool Versioning System**: Version hierarchy with active/archived split and registry-based discovery
4. **PAI-Inspired File Control**: Domain segregation, systematic archival, intelligent routing, quality filtering

### Applied Strategy for 406-Tool Problem

## Emoji System Benefits Analysis
*Established: 2025-01-22*
*Context: User asked how emojis help system organization*

### Computational Benefits
1. **Rapid Pattern Recognition**: Visual cortex processing faster than text parsing
2. **Information Architecture**: Visual hierarchy in file browsers and search results
3. **Scanning Efficiency**: 🔧 FOBs vs FOBs provides faster visual filtering
4. **Domain Boundaries**: Prevents cognitive bleed between contexts

### Practical Impact
- **Time Savings**: 2-3 seconds per discovery × 50 daily searches = 2-3 minutes/day saved
- **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Visual pattern matching reduces mental fatigue
- **Error Prevention**: Domain cues prevent wrong tool usage
- **Professional Presentation**: Demonstrates systematic organization thinking

### Implementation Ready
Phase 1 versioning + emoji domain organization validated as optimal approach.

## Team Knowledge Sharing Agent Creation
*Established: 2025-10-11*
*Decision: "I am not concerned about how long it takes to create or how many agents we end up with"*

### Problem Context
User wants to share Maia's value proposition, workflows, and daily impact with their team. Needs compelling, accessible documentation for multiple audiences (technical/non-technical, management/peers).

### Options Considered
- **Option A**: Use existing agents (Confluence + LinkedIn + Blog Writer) - 2-3 hours
- **Option B**: Create specialized "Team Knowledge Sharing Agent" - 4-6 hours
- **Option C**: Direct content creation (no agent) - 1-2 hours

### Decision
**Option B: Create specialized Team Knowledge Sharing Agent**

### Rationale
- User explicitly stated: "I am not concerned about how long it takes to create or how many agents we end up with"
- Quality > Speed: Purpose-built agent will create better onboarding materials
- Reusability: Valuable for future scenarios (team onboarding, new hires, stakeholder demos)
- Agent ecosystem value: Adds specialized capability vs. one-time manual coordination
- Long-term investment: Better foundation for recurring team knowledge sharing needs

### Implementation Approach
Create "Team Knowledge Sharing Agent" v2.2 Enhanced with specialization in:
- Onboarding material creation (multiple audience types)
- Demo content and case studies
- Value proposition documentation
- Team training materials
- Integration with Confluence Organization Agent for publishing

### Success Criteria
- Team members understand Maia's value in 10-15 minutes
- Content reusable across different audiences
- Agent available for future team sharing scenarios
- Published to Confluence for easy access

### Files to Create
- `claude/agents/team_knowledge_sharing_agent.md` (v2.2 Enhanced template)
- Update `claude/context/core/agents.md` with new agent entry
- Update `SYSTEM_STATE.md` Phase 108 with implementation details

## Mandatory TDD + Agent Pairing Enforcement
*Established: 2025-10-19*
*Decision: "proceed" - Make TDD + agent pairing mandatory for ALL development*

### Problem Context
User wants TDD methodology to be MANDATORY standard practice for all development work, with automatic best-fit agent pairing (domain specialist + SRE agent) to ensure both quality implementation AND production reliability.

### Requirements Confirmed
1. **TDD Scope**: ALL development (tools, agents, features, bug fixes, schema changes)
2. **Exemptions**: Documentation-only, configuration-only changes (no code logic)
3. **Agent Selection**: Self-consultation pattern - Maia asks internally "Which agent would Naythan want?" then proceeds with recommendation
4. **SRE Role**: Full lifecycle (define requirements → collaborate during → review after)
5. **Enforcement**: No skip option - TDD is mandatory, period

### Implementation Approach
**All 4 core guidance files updated**:

1. **tdd_development_protocol.md**:
   - Changed from "triggered by user" to "MANDATORY for all development"
   - Added Agent Pairing Protocol section with self-consultation process
   - Added SRE lifecycle integration (Phase 1-4)
   - Added clear exemptions list (docs-only, config-only)
   - Added domain specialist examples (ServiceDesk→SDM Agent, Security→Security Specialist, etc.)

2. **CLAUDE.md** (Working Principles):
   - Added Principle #16: "MANDATORY TDD + AGENT PAIRING"
   - Added TDD Enforcement to Enforcement Requirements section
   - References tdd_development_protocol.md for complete workflow

3. **systematic_thinking_protocol.md**:
   - Added Phase 0.5: "Development Mode Check" (TDD trigger detection)
   - Updated PRE-RESPONSE CHECKLIST with TDD requirement check
   - Added agent pairing selection template
   - Integrated TDD workflow into systematic framework

4. **identity.md** (Personality Traits):
   - Added "TDD-First" trait to core personality
   - References tdd_development_protocol.md

### Agent Pairing Formula
**Domain Specialist + SRE Principal Engineer Agent (ALWAYS)**

**Self-Consultation Process**:
1. Detect development task type (ServiceDesk, Security, Cloud, Data, etc.)
2. Internally ask: "Which domain specialist would Naythan want for this?"
3. Analyze options (90% domain match, 10% past success)
4. Present recommendation with reasoning
5. Proceed with selected pairing (no approval wait)

### SRE Lifecycle Integration
- **Phase 1 (Requirements)**: Define reliability requirements (observability, error handling, SLOs, data quality)
- **Phase 2-3 (Design/Implementation)**: Collaborate on test coverage, error paths, instrumentation
- **Phase 4 (Review)**: Production readiness, performance validation, security review

### Success Criteria
- 100% of development tasks go through TDD workflow (or documented exemption)
- 100% of TDD projects engage domain specialist + SRE agent
- Zero production deployments without tests
- Zero SRE-critical issues missed (memory leaks, error handling, observability)

### Files Modified
- `claude/context/core/tdd_development_protocol.md` (now 210 lines, +80 lines)
- `claude/context/core/identity.md` (added TDD-First personality trait)
- `CLAUDE.md` (added Working Principle #16 + TDD Enforcement requirement)
- `claude/context/core/systematic_thinking_protocol.md` (added Phase 0.5 TDD trigger)
- `claude/context/core/development_decisions.md` (this entry)

### Enforcement Status
✅ **PRODUCTION ACTIVE** - All new context windows will enforce mandatory TDD + agent pairing
