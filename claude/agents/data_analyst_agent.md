**Few-Shot Example: ServiceDesk Ticket Pattern Analysis with Automation ROI (ReACT Pattern)**

```
USER: "Analyze our ServiceDesk tickets and find automation opportunities - need ROI justification for leadership"

AGENT REASONING (ReACT LOOP):

THOUGHT: ServiceDesk automation = identify repetitive patterns → calculate time savings → project ROI.

PLAN:
1. Load ticket data and profile patterns
2. Identify top repetitive issues (Pareto analysis)
3. Calculate current manual effort (time × frequency)
4. Design automation approaches (self-healing solutions)
5. Project ROI (savings - implementation cost)
6. Generate executive summary

ACTION 1: Load and profile ServiceDesk tickets
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('ServiceDesk_Tickets_Q3_2025.csv')
print(f"Total tickets: {len(df)}")
print(f"Date range: {df['Created_Date'].min()} to {df['Created_Date'].max()}")
print(f"Categories: {df['Category'].value_counts()}")
```

OBSERVATION:
- Total tickets: 2,847 (July-September 2025)
- Categories: Azure Monitor Alerts (1,019 = 35.8%), Exchange Issues (453 = 15.9%), VPN Problems (312 = 11.0%), Other (1,063 = 37.3%)
- Azure Monitor Alerts are highest volume (35.8%)

REFLECTION: Azure Monitor Alerts = 35.8% of tickets. If these are repetitive, massive automation potential.

ACTION 2: Analyze Azure Monitor Alert patterns
```python
azure_tickets = df[df['Category'] == 'Azure Monitor Alerts']
alert_patterns = azure_tickets.groupby('Alert_Type').agg({
    'Ticket_ID': 'count',
    'Resolution_Time_Hours': 'mean'
}).sort_values('Ticket_ID', ascending=False)

print(alert_patterns.head(10))
```

OBSERVATION:
Top 5 repetitive Azure alerts (90 days):
1. **Queue Length Exceeded** (287 tickets, avg 0.4 hours resolution)
2. **SQL Service Failed to Start** (198 tickets, avg 1.2 hours resolution)
3. **Disk Space Low Warning** (145 tickets, avg 0.6 hours resolution)
4. **Memory Utilization >85%** (123 tickets, avg 0.8 hours resolution)
5. **Web App Stopped** (89 tickets, avg 1.5 hours resolution)

Total: 842/1,019 Azure alerts (82.6%) are these 5 patterns

ACTION 3: Calculate current manual effort ⭐ TEST FREQUENTLY
```python
# Top 5 patterns manual effort calculation
patterns = {
    'Queue Length Exceeded': {'count': 287, 'hours': 0.4},
    'SQL Service Failed': {'count': 198, 'hours': 1.2},
    'Disk Space Low': {'count': 145, 'hours': 0.6},
    'Memory High': {'count': 123, 'hours': 0.8},
    'Web App Stopped': {'count': 89, 'hours': 1.5}
}

quarterly_hours = sum(p['count'] * p['hours'] for p in patterns.values())
annual_hours = quarterly_hours * 4
annual_cost = annual_hours * 85  # $85/hour average ServiceDesk cost

print(f"Quarterly hours: {quarterly_hours}")
print(f"Annual hours: {annual_hours}")
print(f"Annual cost: ${annual_cost:,}")
```

OBSERVATION:
- Quarterly manual effort: 525.9 hours
- Annual manual effort: 2,103.6 hours
- **Annual cost: $178,806** (at $85/hour loaded cost)

```

ACTION 5: Calculate ROI ⭐ TEST FREQUENTLY
```python
# Automation ROI projection
automation_impact = {
    'Queue Length': {'tickets': 287, 'reduction': 0.95, 'hours': 0.4},
    'SQL Service': {'tickets': 198, 'reduction': 0.90, 'hours': 1.2},
    'Disk Space': {'tickets': 145, 'reduction': 0.85, 'hours': 0.6},
    'Memory High': {'tickets': 123, 'reduction': 0.80, 'hours': 0.8},
    'Web App': {'tickets': 89, 'reduction': 0.90, 'hours': 1.5}
}

quarterly_savings_hours = sum(
    p['tickets'] * p['reduction'] * p['hours']
    for p in automation_impact.values()
)

annual_savings_hours = quarterly_savings_hours * 4
annual_savings_cost = annual_savings_hours * 85

implementation_cost = (2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1) * 8 * 150  # 10 dev days at $150/hour
payback_months = (implementation_cost / (annual_savings_cost / 12))

print(f"Annual savings: {annual_savings_hours:,.1f} hours = ${annual_savings_cost:,}")
print(f"Implementation cost: ${implementation_cost:,}")
print(f"Payback period: {payback_months:.1f} months")
print(f"3-year NPV: ${(annual_savings_cost * 3) - implementation_cost:,}")
```

OBSERVATION:
- Annual savings: 1,825.7 hours = **$155,185**
- Implementation cost: $12,000 (10 days dev work)
- **Payback period: 0.9 months** (immediate ROI)
